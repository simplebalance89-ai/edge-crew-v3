"""
NFL / NCAAB / NBA pace data via the ESPN team statistics endpoint.

Mirrors services.nhl_pace in spirit: pull a real tempo number from a free
public endpoint, cache it, hand it back as pace_L5 so the existing
score_pace_matchup engine variable can grade fast vs grind matchups.

For football we extract `totalOffensivePlays` and divide by games played
to get plays/game (the canonical NFL pace proxy). For basketball we use
`fieldGoalsAttempted + freeThrowsAttempted` per game as a possessions
proxy — not as clean as KenPom's tempo metric but free and directional.

Both are cached per (sport, team_id) for an hour. ESPN's team statistics
endpoint is rate-friendly so we don't bother with a single-bulk-pull
strategy like NHL — football and college basketball each have only the
teams that show up on a given slate to look up.
